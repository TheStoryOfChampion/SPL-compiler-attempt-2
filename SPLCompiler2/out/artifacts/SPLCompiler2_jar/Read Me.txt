Greetings.

NB NB NB Specifics about my practical:
Please just make sure in the test code the number consts (Class N tokens) have a space on either side of it. e.g instead of havinf  '1', you'd have ' 1 '. In context, for example the code snipper or(0,1) would be or( 0 , 1 ).

Running my programm:
* I have provided a jar file. in the same directory as the jar file.

* Please copy your test files and put them into the same root directory as the jar file.

* Then open your terminal in said directory and run the command 'java -jar SPLCompiler2.jar' without the single quotes.

* Input your file name (case sensitive) with the extension (.txt) into the popup that appears.

* As it stands only the Lexer, Parser and Semantic analyser(scoping) works. so it should output 2 files. one with the parse tree and one with the Symbol Table. These same files will also contain errors should there be any. 
should there be a lexical error, it will not output any files. instead it will output the error in the terminal.


Should anything go wrong, please do not hesitate to contact me via my email (u18045881@tuks.co.za or mbofho47@gmail.com) or via my phone (065 974 9558).
